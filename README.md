# Snack-bar
 A program that makes a set of vending machines, each machine can only sell one product. The user “deposits” quarters, dimes, or nickels into a machine, then presses the “Buy” button and “receives” a product and change. When one of the machines is empty, you can call “service” to restock “merchandise” and empty “cash”.
